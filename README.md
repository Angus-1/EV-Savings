## Problems
The electric vehicle is hot right now, but there are many uniformed or even misguided buyers that don't understand how much and EV should cost, nor how much they actually can save comparing to gasoline vehicle. Every commute is unique, and averages pushed by either the government or private companies are either underestimated or overinflated.
 

## Description
A go-to website that gives users accurate and realistic cost estimates of electric vehicle versus gasoline vehicle. Every commuter has their own unique situation, and each car has their own efficiencies. Our website lets users chose a prospective vehicle, add their mileage, and current mpg/mpge and gas/electric prices in their area, and do some calculations behind the scenes to give them the cost for using that vehicle. It is straightforward, and easy tool to make the leap to the future transparent and easy.
